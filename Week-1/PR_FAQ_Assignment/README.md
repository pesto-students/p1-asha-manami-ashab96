In the new normal remote world modes of teaching is either through sharing screen with Pre-Prepared PPT’s or video lectures with teacher writing on board where visibility of the boards is not good most of the time due to many technical issues, hence these teaching methods could not provide same impact as legacy way of teaching.

All these parameters motivated us to come with this product.

Feedback from on  our renowned Professor is “ *I Professor XYZ , at the start of the pandemic when used to take video classes I used to spend lot of time on  working with technicality to set up the video classes , ex: camera, audio, quality , and very less on the  preparing for the class itself , most of my energy , time ,mental space was occupied by other jargons associated with  method of teaching, by using   **GuruKul-Board now  I dedicate all my time and effort on  preparing  for the class , with this it made my life easier and more like the legacy way of teaching* “**
